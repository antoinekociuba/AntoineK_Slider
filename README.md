AntoineK_MediaChooserField

##Features

* Sort slides by Drag 'n Drop

This extension will render a simple HTML list on the frontend. You will need to add your own JS layer in order to get a real sexy slider.
Actually, I didn't want to choose and include any slider plugin as I know everybody has got its own preference (jQuery, Prototype...).

Enjoy!
