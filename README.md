AntoineK_Slider
===============

A convenient slider extension which allows you to create slider and manage associated slides with ease.

##Requires

AntoineK_MediaChooserField

##Features

* Sort slides by Drag 'n Drop
* CRUD slides operations with Ajax
* Multistore support
* Cache support
* Ability to insert slider via widgets, CMS Wysiwyg, and layout XML updates



This extension will render a simple HTML list on the frontend. You will need to add your own JS layer in order to get a real sexy slider.
Actually, I didn't want to choose and include a slider plugin as I know that everybody has got his own preference (jQuery, Prototype...).

Enjoy!
